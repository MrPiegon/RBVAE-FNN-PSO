This is the official implementation of "Exploring the Chemical Space of Ionic Liquids for CO2 Dissolution through Generative Machine Learning Models". In this work, a generative framework combining re-balanced variational autoencoder (VAE), artificial neural network (ANN), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed based on a comprehensive experimental solubility database from literature.

# Getting Started

## Dataset
For the pre-training SMILES database, you can download the original Pubchem coumpound database at ftp://p.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/. the CO2 solubility dataset is in the Modeldata/CO2ModelData.xlsx
